## How to Run the Project 🚀

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-app.git
cd e-commerce-app
How the App Works 🔧
1. Fetch Products
When the page loads, products are fetched from a remote API (https://dummyjson.com/products) and displayed in a product list. 📦

2. Add Products to Cart
You can add products to the cart by clicking the "Add To Cart" button next to each product. The cart will be updated accordingly. 🛍️

3. Update Cart
Once items are added to the cart, you can:

Increase the quantity: Click the "+" button next to an item to add more. ➕
Decrease the quantity: Click the "-" button to reduce the quantity. If the quantity reaches zero, the item is removed from the cart. ➖
4. Checkout
Once you're ready, click the Checkout button to view your total price and confirm your purchase. 🏁

5. Close Cart
You can toggle the visibility of the shopping cart at any time by clicking on the cart icon at the top-right of the page. 🛒❌
